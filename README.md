## Project Description : 
You Only Look Once or YOLO is an algorithm that detects and recognizes various objects in real time. Object detection in YOLO is done as a regression problem and provides the class probabilities of the detected images. It employs convolutional neural networks (CNN) to detect objects in real-time. As the name suggests, the algorithm requires only a single forward propagation through a neural network to detect objects. This means that prediction in the entire image is done in a single algorithm run. The CNN is used to predict various class probabilities and bounding boxes simultaneously.
